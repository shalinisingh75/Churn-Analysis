- **Churn status** (whether the customer has left the service)

## ✅ Key Tasks Performed

- Data cleaning and type conversion
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Insight generation and churn pattern detection

## 📈 Key Insights

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.
- **Electronic check** payment method is associated with higher churn rates.
- **Tenure** is a strong indicator — newer customers are more likely to leave.
- Lack of add-on services like **online security** or **tech support** correlates with churn.
